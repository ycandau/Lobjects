# Lobjects
A series of Max externals to manipulate lists.

The original externals are by Peter Elsea.
Refactored by Yves Candau.

Main differences:
  - The externals use the new Max style and attributes.
  - The arrays to store lists and messages are resizable.
  - Non int, float or list messages can be processed (starting with a symbol).
