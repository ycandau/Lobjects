# Lobjects

A series of Max externals to manipulate lists, refactored from originals by Peter Elsea.

Main differences:

- The externals use the new Max style and attributes.
- The arrays to store lists and messages are resizable.
- Non int, float or list messages can be processed (messages starting with a symbol).
